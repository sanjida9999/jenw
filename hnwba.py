 ┌──❀*̥˚──◌───◌───◌──❀*̥˚─◌┐
 
        Created by 
       your lil sis
        
       I could have made 
     it a lot better but
       due to lack of 
      time & board exam 
      pressure I couldn't
     make it as special
        as i planned.
      
      the same thing
      had happened in 
     the case of somu di
     (it was even worse
       i couldnt even 
      make her a card
      and I really 
      feel bad about
      it) her bday 
      was during
      (my 5th or 6th 
      subject)boards
      exam day when 
       I had my my 
    english or physics
           paper.
  
    i know somu di dosent 
    mind these lil things 
    but i felt really bad 
     coz she had always 
    suported me and made 
      me laugh just like 
       Aru(Arohi)di..
  
     i didnt want to 
     make the same mistake
     again. And sorry Somu 
     di I couldn't have got 
     a better opportunity
     to apoloize ...
     
     Now this looks like
     some heartfelt 
     speech so I would 
     conclude by saying
 
     THANK YOU DIDI(S) for 
         being there
          by my side  
          
 └◌───❀*̥˚─◌───◌───◌───❀*̥˚┘

            It’s crazy how good of a friend & sis you are,
but it’s even crazier how nutty you are!
It's so fun to live inside your head,
and you will always be my sis until I'm dead.
Wowww it rhymes 😂🤣

May your birthday this
year be just as wild and wonderful,
and as hysterically funny as you are!<br>

You couldn’t be any more wild and
wonderful than you already are, and
I wouldn’t have you any other way!

My best wishes for the didi who says 
and does crazy things.............
I know I'm going to get beaten for
always spilling the beans.🤭🤫🤥🤐
